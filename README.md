# contractor-project-management
Simulating project progress for a contractor company with Python and openpyxl and incorporating:
1. Earned Value Management (EVM)
2. EVM Forecasting
3. ARIMA model to forecast future trends
4. K-Means Clustering to group projects and classify them

# How to use files
## .py files
* Run with [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) in the _contractor-project-management_ folder directory
    * I personally used [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and ran the command: `Python: Run Python File in Terminal` through the command palette (`ctrl + shift + p`)
## .xlsx files
* Open with Microsoft Excel or a tool that can open xlsx files
## .mstr files
* Download and install [MicroStrategy](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/get-started/workstation)
    * Sign up for or Log into MicroStrategy if needed
* Open the .mstr file normally
